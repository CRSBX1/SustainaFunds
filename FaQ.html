        <div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; padding-left: 10%; margin-top: 2.5%">
          <h3>2. How does Sustainafunds work?</h3><br>
          <p>
            Sustainafunds operates on the principle of collective funding. Project creators post their initiatives on our platform,<br>
            set fundraising goals, and offer rewards or incentives to backers. Anyone can browse and support projects by making<br>
            financial contributions.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; padding-left: 10%; margin-top: 2.5%">
          <h3>3. What types of projects are featured on Sustainafunds?</h3><br>
          <p>
            We support a wide range of projects that align with sustainability and environmental protection. This includes renewable<br>
            energy ventures, conservation efforts, eco-friendly product development, community gardens, educational programs, and<br>
            more. If it benefits the planet, it's welcome on Sustainafunds.
          </p>

        <div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; padding-left: 10%; margin-top: 2.5%">
          <h3>4. How can I get involved as a backer?</h3><br>
          <p>
            To support a project on Sustainafunds, simply browse our featured initiatives, choose the one you'd like to support, and<br>
            make a financial contribution. You can explore projects based on categories, funding status, and location to find the<br>
            ones that resonate with you.
          </p>

        <div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; padding-left: 10%; margin-top: 2.5%">
          <h3>5. Can I trust that my contributions will be used responsibly?</h3><br>
          <p>
            We take project transparency seriously. Project creators are required to provide detailed plans on how they intend to use<br>
            the funds they raise. Backers can also track the progress of funded projects, ensuring accountability and transparency<br>
            throughout the process.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; padding-left: 10%; margin-top: 2.5%">
          <h3>6. What happens if a project doesn't reach its funding goal?</h3><br>
          <p>
            If a project fails to meet its funding goal by the specified deadline, no funds are transferred, and backers are not charged<br>
            This approach ensures that projects have the necessary support to move forward successfully.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; padding-left: 10%; margin-top: 2.5%">
          <h3>7. How does Sustainafunds ensure the authenticity of projects?</h3><br>
          <p>
            We review and verify projects before they are allowed on our platform. Our team assesses the project's feasibility, commitment<br>
            to sustainability, and the track record of the creators. This helps maintain the integrity of our platform and ensures that<br>
            only legitimate projects are featured.

        <div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; padding-left: 10%; margin-top: 2.5%">
          <h3>8. Is there a fee for using Sustainafunds?</h3><br>
          <p>
            Sustainafunds charges a reasonable fee to project creators if their projects are successfully funded. This fee helps cover<br>
            the costs of maintaining our platform and providing support to creators throughout their campaigns.
